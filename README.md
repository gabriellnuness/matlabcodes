# MATLAB scripts for scientific work
## This repository contains MATLAB scripts I am using during my master's degree.

Mainly it is focused on few calculations and automations to plot a beautiful graph to my LaTeX dissertation (which I'm also doing the version control in another private git repository)

There is another [repository](https://github.com/gabriellnuness/pythoncodes) for my newly python scripts.


### NOTE: The scripts are in ongoing development.
